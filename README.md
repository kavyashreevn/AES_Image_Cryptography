# AES_Image_Cryptography
Digital images in fields like healthcare, defense, and social media are vulnerable to unauthorized access.
Traditional AES encryption offers security but faces issues such as high computational complexity and pixel correlation when applied directly to images.
This project introduces a Dynamic AES algorithm that uses a Quadratic Map-based key generation to enhance security and reduce processing time.
